This keylogger project was developed using Python as part of my programming studies. It captures and logs keystrokes on a computer, providing an in-depth understanding of how keyboard events work at a system level. The project utilizes Python libraries such as `pynput` to monitor and record key presses in real time. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with handling system events, file management, and working with external libraries. This keylogger demonstrates the practical application of concepts like event-driven programming and file I/O, while also highlighting the importance of ethical considerations and privacy in programming.
